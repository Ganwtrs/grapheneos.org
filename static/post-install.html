                    <p>You've now successfully installed GrapheneOS and can boot it. Pressing the
                    power button with the default Start option selected in the bootloader
                    interface will boot the OS.</p>

                    <p>During first setup, the final screen will contain a toggle regarding OEM
                    unlocking which is checked by default. This will disable OEM unlocking, which is
                    recommended.</p>

                    <p>If you need to enable or disable OEM unlocking in the future, it can be done
                    in the developer settings menu within the operating system.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#verifying-installation">Verifying installation</a></h3>

                    <p>The verified boot and attestation features provided by the supported
                    devices can be used to verify that the hardware, firmware and GrapheneOS
                    installation are genuine. Even if the computer you used to flash GrapheneOS
                    was compromised and an attacker replaced GrapheneOS with their own malicious
                    OS, it can be detected with these features.</p>

                    <p>Verified boot verifies the entirety of the firmware and OS images on every
                    boot. The public key for the firmware images is burned into fuses in the SoC at
                    the factory. Firmware security updates also update the rollback index burned
                    into fuses to provide rollback protection.</p>

                    <p>The final firmware boot stage before the OS is responsible for verifying
                    it. For the stock OS, it uses a hard-wired public key. Installing GrapheneOS
                    flashes the GrapheneOS verified boot public key to the secure element. Each
                    boot, this key is loaded and used to verify the OS. For both the stock OS and
                    GrapheneOS, a rollback index based on the security patch level is loaded from
                    the secure element to provide rollback protection.</p>

                        <p>When loading an alternate OS, the device shows a yellow notice on boot
                        with the ID of the alternate OS based on the sha256 of the verified boot
                        public key. 4th and 5th generation Pixels only show the first 32 bits of
                        the hash so you can't use this approach. 6th generation Pixels onwards
                        show the full hash and you can compare it against the official GrapheneOS
                        verified boot key hashes below:</p>

                        <p>Checking this is useful after installation, but you don't need to check
                        it manually for verified boot to work. The verified boot public key
                        flashed to the secure element can only be changed when the device is
                        unlocked. Unlocking the device performs the same wiping of the secure
                        element as a factory reset and prevents data from being recovered even if
                        the SSD was cloned and your passphrase(s) are obtained because the
                        encryption keys can no longer be derived anymore. The verified boot key is
                        also one of the inputs for deriving the encryption keys in addition to the
                        user's lock method(s) and random token(s) on the secure element.</p>

                        <p>GrapheneOS provides our Auditor app for using a combination of the
                        verified boot and attestation features to verify that the hardware,
                        firmware and operating system are genuine along with providing other
                        useful data from the hardware and operating system.</p>

                        <p>Since the purpose of Auditor is to obtain information about the device
                        without trusting it to be honest, results aren't shown on the device being
                        verified. You need a 2nd Android device running Auditor for local QR code
                        based verification. You can also use our optional device integrity
                        monitoring service for automatic scheduled verifications with support for
                        email alerts.</p>

                        <p>See the <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a>
                        for a guide.</p>

                        <p>Auditor is primarily based on a pairing model where it generates a
                        hardware backed signing key and hardware backed attestation signing key
                        and pins them as part of the initial verification. The first verification
                        is bootstrapped based on chaining trust to one of the Android attestation
                        roots. After the first verification, it provides a highly secure system
                        for obtaining information about the device going forward. An attacker
                        could bypass the initial verification with a leaked attestation key or by
                        proxying to another device with the device model, OS and patch level that
                        the user is expecting. Proxying to another device will be addressed in the
                        future with optional support for the hardware serial number attestation
                        feature.</p>

                    <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is similar to the
                    process described above but with

                    tool</a>. However, before flashing and locking, there's an additional step to
                    fully revert the device to a clean factory state.</p>

                    <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
                    needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. Before flashing the
                    stock factory images, you should boot the device into fastboot mode and make sure the
                    bootloader is unlocked. Then erase the custom Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
